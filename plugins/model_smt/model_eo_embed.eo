; For consistency we name it *.eo.

; tsm.Type:
;   The final embedding of atomic SMT-LIB types that are relevant to the VC.
; sm.Term:
;   The final embedding of atomic SMT-LIB terms that are relevant to the VC.
; eo.Term:
;   The final embedding of Eunoia terms that are relevant to the VC.
;   SMT-LIB terms, types and values are embedded in this datatype. This
;   datatype contains a superset of the Herbrand universe of all types being
;   considered.
;   We require a mutually recursive datatype, since these are
;   inter-dependent.
