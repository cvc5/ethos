ethos 0.2.0
===========

- When parsing Eunoia signatures, decimals and hexidecimals are never normalized, variables in binders are always unique for their name and type, and let is never treated as a builtin way of specifying macros. The options `--no-normalize-dec`, `--no-normalize-hex`, `--binder-fresh`, and `--no-parse-let` now only apply when parsing proofs and reference files.
- Adds a new option `--normalize-num`, which also only applies when reference parsing. This option treats numerals as rationals, which can be used when parsing SMT-LIB inputs in logics where numerals are shorthand for rationals.
- Makes the `set-option` command available in proofs and Eunoia files.
- Adds `--include=X` and `--reference=X` to the command line interface for including (reference) files.
- Fixed the disambiguation of overloaded symbols that are not applied to arguments.
- Fixed the interpretation of operators that combine opaque and ordinary arguments.
- Fixed a bug in the evaluation of `eo::cons` for left associative operators, which would construct erroneous terms.
- Adds support for `eo::dt_constructors` which returns the list of constructors associated with a datatype, and `eo::dt_selectors` which returns the list of selectors associated with a datatype constructor. These operators make use of a type `eo::List`, which is now part of the background signature assumed by Ethos.
- Fixed parser for the singleton case of `declare-datatype`.

ethos 0.1.0
===========

This is the initial release of the Ethos proof checker.  Ethos implements the Eunoia logical framework which is a logical framework targeted at SMT solvers.  It allows users to define proof formats and write proofs.

This release of Ethos is associated with the 1.2.0 release of the SMT solver cvc5.  It can check the proofs generated by cvc5's native proof format `cpc`.  Ethos and Eunoia have reached a certain level of stability, but they are still under active development.
